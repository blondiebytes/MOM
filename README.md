## Inspiration
Coming up with ideas is hard. That's why we created an Alexa Skill and web application called Mind Over Matter - or what we like to call MOM. Now, you have someone to bounce ideas off of and together, you can come up with an idea that is truly unique.

## How it works
Start the MOM skill by saying "Alexa, Start Mind Over Matter." Then, state your assignment (report, project, etc) or a subject you are interested in. Alexa will give you readily available topics to research into and help you discover what you really want to know. When you are done, be sure to say "Review My Brainstorm" so you can see how far you've come. Once you are done, go to your dashboard to get more data about your brainstorm session.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Limitations of Alexa cards.
2. Getting data from the Echo to the personal dashboard.
